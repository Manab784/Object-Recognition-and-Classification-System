# Object Recognition System
#### An Object Recognition and classification system has been built here. The code is mainly divided into two parts :

#### 1. *Object Recognition in still/non movable images* 
#### 2. *Object Detection in live images*


### Object Recognition
#### The user is given a choice to select local files from the file dialogue of their own device and upload it into the GUI, which passes it on to the *Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)* for processing and returns the *Class Name* of the image with a specific level of accuracy.
